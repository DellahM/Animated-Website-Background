JavaScript Functionality:

The JavaScript code initializes the canvas and its context.
A Line class is created to represent each line in the animation. Each line has random starting and ending points, a random color with varying opacity, and a random speed.
The update method moves the line slightly in random directions, keeping it within the canvas bounds.
The draw method draws the line on the canvas.
The animate function clears the canvas and redraws all lines in their updated positions, creating the animation effect.
